## Precise Selection of Extremely Red Quasars

### 1-Sample selection 
Sampling from the emission line catalog in H17
### 2-Luminosity Matching
Matching the luminosity of the selected sample with the Luminosity of ERQs
### 3-Sample Statistics 
Statistical difference between ERQs and other QSos
### 4-Kernel Density Estimation
 Applying KDE on the parameter space for checking the density 
behavior of ERQs in comparison to the normal blue QSOs and obtaining the 
uncertainties based on Bootstrap re-sampling
### 5- Median Spectra 
Comparing Median spectra of ERQs with other QSOs in 2D and 3D to find the the
best boundary of ERQs
